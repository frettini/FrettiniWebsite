          SelfCARE is the result of the 48h GUDEV Game Jam 9. It was a solo project and came in first place of the Jam! <br>
          SelfCARE is a puzzle game where the player matches the shapes. To do so, the user clicks on a first shape and drags it to the next one.
          In case of a mistake, the player can click on the line itself to erase it. There are 16 levels to complete and a 10 minute soundtrack to enjoy.
          The game was built to be relaxing, calm, and polished. I kept the scope of the development very small so that I could focus on simple
          yet effective graphics and a long single soundtrack. The game was created using the Unity engine, Photoshop, and Reaper.

          <b>Programming : </b> <br>
          The goal of the game is very simple, and so is the programming behind it. There are two main parts: level generation and input control. <br>
          A level generation was implemented in order to quickly build many levels. This was done by using a grid system. The size of the level, and
          the location of the boy and of the shapes are then specified to place each element correctly.<br>
          The input control looks at the location of the mouse on click. Again the grid system is used to check if the mouse within the level, on a shape
          or on a line. The logic acts accordingly. Each shape is specified in pair, and needs to be connected to finish the level. Everytime a pair is connected,
          the level manager is notified and checks if the level is completed.

          <b>Graphics : </b> <br>
          The graphics of the game are also basic. They were made using a large brush in Photoshop. Each animated element is drawn three times to create that 
          sense of motion.

          <b>Music : </b> <br>
          The main goal of this soundtrack is to be soothing and relaxing. It was made using recordings (from <a href="https://freesound.org/">freesounds.org</a>) 
          of the ocean, rivers, and wind going through the trees. Interleaved with it are three piano tracks that appear at intervals. The full sound track can be
